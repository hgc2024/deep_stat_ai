Testing Question: List some of the greatest rookie seasons in NBA history.

--- ARCHITECT PLAN ---
1. Load 'game_stats' table.
2. Filter for players who played their first season (e.g., MIN > 480 or MIN > 750 minutes).
3. Group by PLAYER_NAME and SEASON.
4. Calculate Aggregates: SUM(PTS) as Total_Points, AVG(PTS) as Avg_Points, AVG(REB) as Avg_Rebounds, AVG(AST) as Avg_Assists.
5. Order by Total_Points DESC.
6. Select TOP 10 to provide a broad perspective on the greatest rookie seasons in NBA history.

--- CODER CODE ---
```python
import duckdb

con = duckdb.connect('nba.duckdb')

# Q: List some of the greatest rookie seasons in NBA history.
query = """
    SELECT gs.PLAYER_NAME, 
           g.SEASON,
           SUM(gs.PTS) as Total_Points,
           AVG(gs.PTS) as Avg_Points,
           AVG(gs.REB) as Avg_Rebounds,
           AVG(gs.AST) as Avg_Assists
    FROM game_stats gs
    JOIN games g ON gs.GAME_ID = g.GAME_ID
    WHERE gs.MIN > 480 -- Filter for players who played their first season (e.g., MIN > 480 minutes)
    GROUP BY gs.PLAYER_NAME, g.SEASON
    ORDER BY Total_Points DESC
    LIMIT 10
"""

df = con.execute(query).df()
print(df)
```

✅ Verification Success: Code includes correct join logic and adheres to schema.
