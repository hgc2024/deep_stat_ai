Testing Question: List some of the greatest rookie seasons in NBA history.

--- ARCHITECT PLAN ---
1. Load 'games' table and 'game_stats' table.
2. Join 'games' with 'game_stats' on GAME_ID.
3. Group by PLAYER_NAME, SEASON (to find the best instances in history).
4. Calculate Aggregates: SUM(PTS) as Total_Points, MIN(SEASON) as First_Season.
5. Order by Total_Points DESC and First_Season ASC to prioritize players with higher points and earlier debuts.
6. Select TOP 10 to provide a broad perspective on the greatest rookie seasons in NBA history.

--- CODER CODE ---
```python
query = """
WITH player_milestones AS (
    SELECT gs.PLAYER_NAME, 
           MIN(g.SEASON) as First_Season,
           MAX(g.SEASON) as Final_Season
    FROM game_stats gs
    JOIN games g ON gs.GAME_ID = g.GAME_ID
    GROUP BY gs.PLAYER_NAME
)
SELECT gs.PLAYER_NAME, 
       mil.First_Season as Season,
       SUM(gs.PTS) as Total_Points
FROM game_stats gs
JOIN games g ON gs.GAME_ID = g.GAME_ID
JOIN player_milestones mil ON gs.PLAYER_NAME = mil.PLAYER_NAME 
                          AND g.SEASON = mil.First_Season -- Filter for FIRST season
GROUP BY gs.PLAYER_NAME, mil.First_Season
ORDER BY Total_Points DESC, First_Season ASC
LIMIT 10
"""
df = con.execute(query).df()
print(df)
```

✅ Verification Success: Code includes correct join logic and adheres to schema.
